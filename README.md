I'm a Student studying in Bengaluru, India. I have hopes of becoming a Programmer, and thus am learning C, C++, HTML, and CSS, along with the Game Engine Unreal Engine.
I also use Linux Fedora Workstation, along with Hyprland.
I like watching Anime such as JuJutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer. I also like playing games that run on Integrated Graphics, such as Hollow Knight and Disco Elysium, along with drawing.
I'm currently being tortured by Exams, so i'm unable to do much coding in the meanwhile.
I'm looking for a person who know's Blender to collaborate with me om Unreal Projects.
